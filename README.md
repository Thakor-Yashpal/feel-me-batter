<b>One specific time I welcomed a new person into one of my communities was when I volunteered at a local community center. The center offered a variety of programs and services, including a youth mentoring program that I was involved in.

One day, a new student joined the mentoring program and was visibly nervous about being in a new environment. To make them feel welcome and included, I introduced myself and asked them about their interests and hobbies. I also showed them around the center and introduced them to other students in the program.

Throughout the day, I made sure to include the new student in conversations and activities, and encouraged them to share their own ideas and perspectives. I also checked in with them periodically to see how they were feeling and offered support when needed.

Through this experience, I learned how important it is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers. I also gained an appreciation for the challenges that new members may face when joining a community and the importance of actively engaging with them to make them feel valued and included.

As a Student Ambassador, I would use this experience to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for new students on campus. I would work to establish a culture of inclusivity and respect, and promote awareness of the different backgrounds and perspectives that make up our diverse student body. I would also make myself available to new students and offer guidance and support as they navigate the campus community. Additionally, I would actively seek out opportunities to connect new students with existing communities and provide them with resources and tools to help them thrive academically and socially.</b>
